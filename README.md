# PS7

Develop your own Random Forests!

This is due on __November 28__.

## Objective:

Using the Breast Cancer dataset available in Scikit-Learn, develop your own Random Forest classification algorithm.
Requirements and parameters that your implementation should have (at the minimum):
  1. Number of Decision Trees to Generate.
  2. Depth of the Decision Trees.
  3. Number of bootstrapped sample sets.
  4. Size of sample sets.
  
## Requirements

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Modeling
  * Restricted to only using the DecisionTree Classifier
3. Model Analysis with SHAP
